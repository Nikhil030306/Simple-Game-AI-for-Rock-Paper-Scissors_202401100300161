Methodology
The implementation of the game follows these key steps:

User Input Handling:

The program prompts the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
Input validation ensures that only valid choices are accepted.
Random Selection by Computer:

The computer makes a random choice from the list of valid options.
Comparison and Decision Logic:

The program compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice and determines the winner based on predefined game rules.
Loop for Replaying:

The program continuously runs in a loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.
Modular Approach:

Functions are used to enhance code reusability and readability.
